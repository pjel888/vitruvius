## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Terminal output | RELIABLE | Stage 0 stdout, branch, status, HEAD, and origin/main were visible. |
| Promotion apply implemented | YES | Resource-only and resource_and_links apply are implemented in Hono/API and service code. |
| resource_and_links implemented | YES | Explicit node ids, valid relation, per-node rationale, and learner eligibility gates are enforced. |
| Resource-only rollback | YES | Preview/apply use transaction-backed temp fixture flows. |
| Resource-and-links rollback | YES | Owned links are removed before the Resource on hard-delete rollback; unrelated dependent links block hard delete. |
| Production resources | 7 | No production resource mutation observed. |
| Production nodeResourceLinks | 9 | No production link mutation observed. |
| Production external metadata candidates | 0 | Registry remains clean after tests. |
| Graph/canonical changes | NONE | No authorized graph, canonical, P0, or high-risk P1 mutation. |
| External verification | NONE | No URL, DOI, ISBN, API, or source lookup was performed. |
| Learner exposure | NONE | resource_and_links defaults to `needs_review`; accepted links are blocked unless `isLearnerSidebarEligible` passes. |
| Transaction manifest | PASS | Apply/rollback manifests are written for temp fixture write operations and include resources, links, and candidate registry where applicable. |
| API routes | PASS | Hono routes mounted for apply preview, apply, rollback preview, and rollback. |
| Audit | PASS | `.ai/02_audits/2026-05-05_resource_and_links_implementation_audit.md`. |

## Validation Evidence

Latest successful validation evidence recorded in
`.ai/13_research/continuous_vitruvius_validation_log.md`:

- `bun run api/validateResourceLayer.ts -- --no-write`
- `bun run api/validateGraphRelationships.ts -- --no-write`
- `bun run api/validateCanonicalGraphStewardship.ts -- --no-write`
- `bun test api/resourceLayerExternalCandidatePromotionApply.test.ts` (56 pass)
- focused Resource/Evidence tests
- `cd api && bun test`
- `cd explorer && bun test`
- `cd explorer && bun run build`
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest scripts/tests/test_kg_aec_relationship_improvement.py`

Known non-blocking validation caveats:

- Explorer tests emit an existing React key warning in `ResourceReviewAdmin`.
- Explorer build emits existing Vite chunk-size warnings.
- Code intelligence refresh completed with ChunkHound degraded warnings for large-file timeouts and embedding errors, while GitNexus and code-review-graph completed.
- Whole-worktree GitNexus detect-changes reports high risk because the repository already has hundreds of unrelated dirty files. Staged-only checks must be used before commit.

## Open Quality Items

1. Complete remaining full validation for Phase 6P-impl.
2. Commit and push only scoped Resource/Evidence implementation, audit, and state files.
3. Produce final Resource/Evidence baseline closure if branch sync and production-cleanliness checks remain green.

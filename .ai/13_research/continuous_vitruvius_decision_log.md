## Decision: Phase 6N Resource-Only Implementation

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Decision:** Implement resource_only promotion apply infrastructure

**Rationale:**
- Phase 6M audit verdict: PASS_ALLOW_PHASE_6N_RESOURCE_ONLY_IMPLEMENTATION
- Phase 6L design specified all gates, API routes, transaction model, and rollback
- resource_only mode is safe: no nodeResourceLinks, no learner exposure, no external verification

**Scope:**
- Gate implementation A-I (skipping F for resource_only)
- 4 API routes: preview, apply, rollback-preview, rollback
- Transaction manifest + rollback model
- Test suite for all gate groups

**Consequences:**
- Promotion apply infrastructure exists (resource_only mode)
- resource_and_links remains blocked
- Next phase: 6O independent audit

## Decision: Resource ID Prefix

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Decision:** Use `res_<uuid>` for resource IDs

**Rationale:**
- Clear prefix for identification
- UUID v4 ensures uniqueness
- No sequential IDs to prevent collision

---

## Decision: Manifest-based Rollback

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Decision:** Rollback writes its own transaction manifest

**Rationale:**
- Audit trail preservation
- Rollback operations are traceable
- Supports both hard_delete and mark_rolled_back

---

## Decision: No Automated Production Promotion

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Decision:** Phase 6N does not auto-promote any production candidates

**Rationale:**
- Production external candidate count is 0
- Any production promotion requires explicit authorization and passing all gates
- The infrastructure is implemented and tested, but not executed against production data
